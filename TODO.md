# TODO
- [ ] Identify differences by newline (this line does not exist in the other)
- [ ] very basic UI displaying text and highlighting differences by newline

# Somewhat near future
- [ ] If a paragraph does not exist exactly in each other, identify, is it a 'different' paragraph or essentially the same paragraph but with minor differences (what's the threshold for determining this?)
- [ ] For same-same paragraph, identify specific word/char difference

# Further out future
- [ ] Update UI to distinguish word/char differences
